# uptime
Python script to check and monitor network connection

Must have a python runtime environment

Navigate to the directory and execute with: python .\uptime.py

To run headless Try: nohup python uptime.py >>&/dev/null &

------------------------------

Please note it actually creates open connections, not a typical ICMP echo "ping"

Please do not use to DOS an IP:port with open connections...

:wq!
